* Global commands that won't affect fringe search
weak_channel  0.0           * don't mark weak channels
ref_freq      86238.703125  * 86209.703125 + 58/2.

* avoid adhoc errors from using too many freq
freqs a b c d e f g h

* More global commands
optimize_closure true   * minimize the contribution of non-closing delay
pc_mode          manual * use manual phase-cal phase

* Set up reasonable windows
sb_win -0.150 0.150   * reasonable single band delay search window in us
mb_win -1.000 1.000 * reasonable multiband delay search window in us
dr_win -1.e-6 1.e-6 * reasonable delay-rate search window in us/s

* ALMA rate window
if station A
  dr_win -1.5e-6 1.5e-6

* skip the DBBC3 Effelsberg redundant signal
if station B skip true

* should not be needed for 2018+ ... but it still is.. but cannot fix with 32 MHz channels
* if station A pc_delay_l 0.0
* if station A pc_delay_r 0.0

* RCP sampling problem in the RDBE? solve by.. adjusting ALMA to match 180 degree shift
* do NOT do this because later in pipeline we rely on ALMA R-L to be delay calibrated..
* if station A pc_delay_r 15.625

* instead do this (and change pcal pc_phases to use R+L average)
* do NOT do this because HOPS will not add pc_phases and pc_phases_r, it will replace one with the other
* UNLIKE delay_offs and delay_offs_r (which are added)
* if not station A
*     pc_phases_r abcdefgh 0. 180. 0. 180. 0. 180. 0. 180.

* instead do this (but then delay_offs needs to reference to R not L
if not station A
    pc_delay_r 15.625
